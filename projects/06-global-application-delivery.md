# Global Application Delivery

## Goal
Deliver a web application across multiple regions with resilience and low latency.

## Architecture work
Design DNS steering, CDN, WAF and regional load balancers; define health checks; protect origin access; test regional failure and cache behavior; document observability.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Requirements, assumptions and constraints
- [ ] Logical and physical topology diagrams
- [ ] IP addressing and routing plan
- [ ] Security zones and allowed-flow matrix
- [ ] Configuration or infrastructure-as-code source
- [ ] Validation plan with expected results
- [ ] Controlled failure and recovery test
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard and operations runbook
- [ ] Sanitized evidence and cleanup record

## Design review questions
1. What are the trust boundaries and failure domains?
2. How does the return path work?
3. How are DNS, identity and certificates handled?
4. What happens when a link, node, region or provider fails?
5. How will changes be reviewed, rolled back and audited?
